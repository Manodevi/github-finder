# GitHub Finder - React App - [View here](https://githubfinder-11567.web.app)
## How I Worked on this app

My goal is to practice react app using class component and make them to convert to functional component with React Hooks.
* Installed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Axios library - to make Github API request.
* API - third party [Github API](https://api.github.com/users)
* Github icon from [Font-awesome](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta2/css/all.min.css)
* Routing - [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
* App Level State Management - __Context API__, I didn't use a state management library like Redux on purpose. For this simple app, Context API is sufficient.
* React Hooks Practiced - 
  * useState
  * useReducer
  * useEffect
  * useContext

## Why I built this project

My plan is to become a full-stack MERN developer eventually. But for the beginning I focus on the frontend - React. That's why I decided to use an existing API rather to create a custom server.
